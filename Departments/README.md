Departments do many unique things that help the town in their unique ways. Joining a department is completely optional and voluntary. Departments enhance the connection between town projects and town members bringing forth an optimal solution for finding the right work style for the right members.

The following are brief descriptions of each department. Some departments will naturally require more effort and responsibility than others. However, the time commitment is completely up to you. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Recruitment</b>: Recruiters invite and help new residents join the town. This includes touring newcomers and selling out plots to them, as well as helping them with rules and commands.</li>
    <li><b>Maintenance</b>: Maintainers do random checkups on roads and plots. They clear plots that are unfinished and inactive, and fix roads that might have been griefed.</li>
    <li><b>Builders</b>: Builders build simple roads to elaborate wonders for the town. Resources and schematic files may be provided.</li>
    <li><b>Resource</b>: Resource gatherers mine/collect resources needed for the town.</li>
    <li><b>Commerce</b>: Merchants maintain shops and/or create new ones.</li>
    <li><b>Map Art</b>: Map artists do horizontal pixel art, which is then mapped to produce beautiful paintings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Contact town mayors, associates, or assistants if you would like to join a department and help out. We would very much appreciate it.
